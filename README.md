# 📂 Data Structures in C

This repository contains **implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms** using **C programming language**. These programs help understand how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated efficiently.

## 📌 Explanation of Each Topic

### 🔹 Linked List
A **linked list** is a collection of nodes where each node contains:
1. **Data** (the actual value).
2. **Pointer** to the next node.

Unlike arrays, linked lists **don’t require continuous memory** and can **grow dynamically**. They are useful for implementing **stacks, queues, and graphs**.

### 🔹 Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
A **stack** follows the **LIFO** principle, meaning:
- The **last** item added is the **first** to be removed.
- Think of a **stack of plates**—you remove the top plate first.

#### **Basic Operations:**
- **Push:** Add an item to the stack.
- **Pop:** Remove the top item from the stack.
- **Peek:** Check the top item without removing it.

---

### 🔹 Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)
A **queue** follows the **FIFO** principle, meaning:
- The **first** item added is the **first** to be removed.
- Think of a **line at a ticket counter**—people leave in the order they arrive.

#### **Basic Operations:**
- **Enqueue:** Add an item to the queue.
- **Dequeue:** Remove the front item from the queue.

### 🔹 Sorting Algorithms
Sorting is the process of **arranging data in order** (ascending or descending).

- **🟢 Bubble Sort** – Compares adjacent elements and swaps if needed. **(Simple but slow)**  
- **🟢 Insertion Sort** – Picks one element at a time and inserts it in the correct position. **(Good for small data)**  
- **🟢 Quick Sort** – Uses a **pivot** to divide the array and sort both parts separately. **(Fast for large data)**  
- **🟢 Selection Sort** – Finds the smallest element and swaps it to its correct position. **(Easy but inefficient)**  

---

### 🔹 Searching Algorithms
Searching is used to **find an element** in a collection of data.

- **🔍 Linear Search** – Checks each element one by one. **(Simple but slow)**  
- **🔍 Binary Search** – **(Only for sorted data)** Divides the list into halves and searches efficiently. **(Very fast)**

### 🔹 Postfix Notation (Reverse Polish Notation)
In **Postfix Notation**, the **operator comes after the operands** instead of between them.

## 🎯 Why Learn Data Structure?
✅ They are **fundamental** for coding, interviews, and real-world applications.  
✅ They **optimize** how data is stored and retrieved.  
✅ They help in building **complex applications** like databases, compilers, and operating systems.
